# CYSE130ProjectAnalysis

This project aims to design and overall plan out a cybersecurity system for a theoretical company. 
Throughout this project, we have utilized system engineering principles, UML modeling, and Python
automation in order to create this comprehensive cybersecurity system. 

To view the UML models, simply go to the "Group Project CYSE130" folder and then go to the 
"Group Project Initial Planning and Design Week-5" folder. From there, the "System Requirements Document" 
file provides a SysML System Requirement diagram link provided in a powerpoint, and a UML diagram link that
provides a UML diagram. There is also a list of the requirements categorized by number, with each subsection
underneath each specific requirement. 

To view the Automation assignment, go to the "Group Project CYSE130" folder and then go to the
"Group Project Automation Assignment" folder. From there, there are 4 separate Python files that each represent
a task based on the challenge needed to solve. There is also an Automation Report file that provides the description
of each task and the intended goal. In order to run "CYSE130-Task1.py" task, take the code and paste it into a Python
Interpreter, such as VSC. Download the "Linux_2k.log" file. Then, in order to run it, make sure to replace the "path"
variable with a path to the Linux_2k.log file on your system, as it may vary depending on the structure of your system's
files. Then, run the code and once it finishes, a file called "summary_logs.txt" that provides a summary of how many
login anomalies are provided based on the Linux security log. In order to run "CYSE130-Task2.py", take the code and paste
it into a Python Interpreter. Then, just simply run the code. Depending on what you set the interval to (default value
is currently set to 5 seconds),
